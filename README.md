# Password Strength Checker in Java

This Java program checks the strength of a given password based on specific rules and conditions. It categorizes passwords into four levels of strength: Weak, Medium, Good, and Strong.

## How to Use

1. **Download the Code**: You can either clone this repository or simply download the `strength.java` file to your local machine.

2. **Compile the Java Code**:

   Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved `strength.java`, and compile the code using the `javac` command:

   ```bash
   javac strength.java
   ```

3. **Run the Program**:

   After successfully compiling the code, run the program with the `java` command:

   
   java strength
   ```

4. **Input Password**:

   The program will prompt you to enter a password. Type the password you want to check and press Enter.

   Example:
   ```
   Enter the password: MySecureP@ssw0rd
   ```

5. **View Password Strength**:

   The program will analyze the password based on the following criteria:

   - Rule 1: Contains at least one uppercase letter.
   - Rule 2: Contains at least one lowercase letter.
   - Rule 3: Contains at least one digit.
   - Rule 4: Contains at least one special character.

   It will then determine the password's strength and display it on the screen.

   Example Output:
   ```
   Password Strength: Strong
   ```

6. **Repeat as Needed**:

   You can repeat the process with different passwords as many times as you like.

7. **Enjoy Password Strength Analysis**:

   Use this simple Java program to assess the strength of your passwords and ensure they meet the recommended criteria for security.

## Customization

You can customize this code to fit your specific password strength requirements or integrate it into other Java applications as needed.
